This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer will churn so that telecom companies can take actions to retrain their customers. The telecom customer churn data was used here is originally provided by the IBM Watson Analytics and available in Kaggle. This project applied three types of mining algorithms, classification, regression, and clustering to this binary classification problem. The specific models used are random forest, gradient boosting machine, logistic regression and KNearest Neighbors.
